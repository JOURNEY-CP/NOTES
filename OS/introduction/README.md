# Introduction

## Introduction About Operating System
An operating system (OS) is the software component of a computer system that is responsible for the management and coordination of activities and the sharing of the resources of the computer. The OS acts as a host for application programs that are run on the machine.

## Memory 
The bridge between Hard drive and CPU. Every data which is to be accessed will gets stored here from harddrive. We can refer this as our RAM.
## CPU
Stands for "Central Processing Unit." The CPU is the primary component of a computer that processes instructions. It runs the operating system and applications, constantly receiving input from the user or active software programs. 

## Evolution of OS
Days back people used to write codes directly in machine language and want to manage all things like using resourses prioritizing their tasks etc by themself.

Then OS evolved which manages the shared resources or shedule the processs etc can be done

OS acts as a bridge between applications and core hardware.

## Types of OS
### 1. Batch Oprating System
Its a bit like old day computer labs where users wont access computer but weite codes and hand over them to computer operator by string in tapes or punch cards. Computer operator runs them and gives output to students when he get.
### 2. Time-Sharing Operating System
### 3. Embedded Operating System
A small os which is relevent to a specific task

Ex: Your camera needs some functionalities. A os is designed for them.
- light in weight
- Task specific
- highly efficient
