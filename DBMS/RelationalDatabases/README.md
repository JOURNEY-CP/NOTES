## RDBMS:
RDBMS stands for relational database management system. A relational model can be represented as a table of rows and columns. A relational database has following major components:
### Table:
A table is a collection of data represented in rows and columns. Each table has a name in database.
### Record or Tuple:
Each row of a table is known as record. It is also known as tuple.
### Field or Column name or Attribute:
For example if we see student database table, stud_id,stud_name,stud_addr and stud_age are attributes.
### Domain:
A domain is a set of permitted values for an attribute in table. For example, a domain of month-of-year can accept January, February,…December as values,a domain of dates can accept all possible valid dates etc. We specify domain of attribute while creating a table.An attribute cannot accept values that are outside of their domains.For example if we declare stud_id as int in student database table so that stud_id cannot accept values that are not integers for example, stud_id cannot has values like, “First”, 10.11 etc.
