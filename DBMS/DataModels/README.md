## Data Models in DBMS
Data Model gives us an idea that how the final system will look like after its complete implementation. It defines the data elements and the relationships between the data elements. Data Models are used to show how data is stored, connected, accessed and updated in the database management system. Here, we use a set of symbols and text to represent the information so that members of the organisation can communicate and understand it.

### Entity Realtionship Model
An ER model describes the structure of a database with the help of a diagram, which is known as Entity Relationship Diagram (ER Diagram).An ER model is a design or blueprint of a database that can later be implemented as a database
- An ER diagram shows the relationship among entity sets
- An entity set is a group of similar entities and these entities can have attributes
- In terms of DBMS, an entity is a table or attribute of a table in database, so by showing relationship among tables and their attributes, ER diagram shows the complete logical structure of a database.
