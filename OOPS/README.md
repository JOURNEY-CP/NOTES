# Object Oriented Programming
## Class
Its like a signature which consists all data methods access specifiers etc
```cpp
class Person{
    // your Code
};
```
## Object
Instance of class is called a object
```cpp
Person P;
```
## Static Data in Class
- Data is not created in every instance
- It is the shared data between all instances
```cpp

```
## Abstraction
Hiding Unnesassary data
### Acess Specifiers
-  ```public```: Allowed from anywhere
-  ```private```: Allowed only in class
-  ```protected```: Allowed in class and in inherited classes
